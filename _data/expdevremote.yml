      \ PhantomJS to convert our CEFSharp forms into PDFs, for writing to \nlocal USB devices as a re\
      cord of the form data captured during an interview, or \nintegrating C++ libraries written in-h\

      to use in what situations and you know how to \ndesign a scalable server\_\n * Multi-threading \
      and async: you know your critical sections from your \nmutexes, semaphores and locks; and your \
      brain works like the Windows scheduler \nso deciding between thread or and process based design\
      \ is as natural to you as \nbreathing\n * Unit testing: you visualise how to unit test it befor\
      e you even create a \nclass for the business feature\n * Design patterns and SOLID: you know th\

      \ of us: You call a business and get routed to a call \ncenter. You get put on hold. The rep do\
      esn't know much about your problem. You \nhang up in frustration and ready to pull your hair ou\
      t. And the entire \nsituation leaves you with more questions than when you called!\nThe Solutio\
      n\nNow imagine the same scenario with the power of Call Compass, the app we're \nbuilding. Call\
      \ Compass provides analytics to businesses on the individual call \nlevel, and bubbles up actio\
      nable information to managers to improve every \ninteraction of their phone reps. \"Customer le\
      ft on hold too long\", \"Agent not \ninformed about the product\", \"Agent not speaking clearly\"\
      , etc. are just a few \nof the reasons that might help managers improve customer interaction.\n\
      And the best part is that this technology can be automated and extend to small \nand medium siz\
      ed businesses! With our 2 patents (and counting), Call Compass \ncan be the de facto standard s\
      tandard for any small and medium sized businesses \nwhere the boss is busy working and unable t\
      o monitor the calls of their front \noffice staff.\nWe're a small team with a proven track reco\
      rd. Our founders have sold \nbusinesses to IAC and Spotify, and we're ready for our next challe\
      nge. Come \nhelp us build our first prototype of Call Compass on a contract basis. And if \nwe \
      like each other enough, this can develop into a longer-term role from there!\nSkills\nWe're loo\
      king for a full stack developer - someone who can both build an \napplication, scale it, and ha\
      ndle the sys admin side of things as well. Much of \nthe prototype will likely be built off of \
      APIs, so excellent knowledge of APIs \nis important as well. We're just getting started in buil\
      ding the app, but plan \non using React, Rails, and AWS - but of course, open to your suggestio\
      ns as \nwell!\nYou'll be the first developer on board, so we'll look to you for leadership in \n\
      terms of development decisions, database design, and infrastructure (likely \nAWS). You should \
      have excellent communication skills and be able to lead the \ntechnical development side of the\
      \ application while during this contract period."

      https://www.catylist.com <https://www.catylist.com> \nAbout Us\nWe\u2019re a small, fully-remot\
      e team focussed on building great products for an \nindustry (commercial real estate) that\u2019\
      s still largely undisrupted by \ntechnology. Our wild start-up days are behind us \u2013 we're \
      all grown up and \nprofitable now with a 15-year track record and users who love us. We launche\
      d a \nnew product last year that's driving a lot of growth, and we could really use \nsome help\
      .\n\n * Our team is mainly full-stack, Java developers, but we've been using \nReactJS for most\
      \ new development for the past couple years (with Java on the \nserver-side).\n * We use a micr\
      oservices architecture, practice continuous integration, and \nhost everything from AWS.\n * We\
      're not dogmatic about our tools/technologies \u2013 we use whatever best \nsuits the task at h\
      and.\_\n * We communicate mainly via Slack and GitLab, but get everybody together for \nface-ti\
      me at least twice a year.\nAbout You\n\n * You're an expert with JavaScript, loving the good pa\
      rts and understanding \nthe bad.\n * You have a good amount of experience with ReactJS, and hav\
      e (at least) \nbuilt something non-trivial with it.\n * You're comfortable with a command line.\n\
      \ * You're a quick study, stay up with the latest-and-greatest ideas and \nprocesses, and consc\
      iously work to become a better developer every day.\_\n * You understand that working as part o\
      f a small team means wearing lots of \ndifferent hats.\n * You value stability, work/life balan\
      ce, group decision-making, and working \nwith people that are good-natured, interesting, hard-w\
      orking, and \nself-motivated.\nCatylist is for you if...\n\n * You hate the corporate bureaucra\
      cy of a big company.\n * You're over the chaos and uncertainty of a start-up. You like having \n\
      reasonable hours and knowing that your job will be around next week.\n * You enjoy maintaining \
      and improving the products you've built rather than \nhanding them off and moving on to the nex\
      t thing.\_This is a full-time, 40 hours \nper week, remote, W2 position with benefits (health/d\
      ental/vision/401k)."

   content: "Hello there! My name is Lowell Heddings, and I'm a terrible programmer. Why \nwould anyb\
      ody let me near the code, you ask?\_\n\nWell, it's because I'm the founder and owner of How-To \
      Geek, the best (and \nbiggest) technology how-to site on the internet. And I'm great at hacking\
      \ \nthings together to make them work, but writing maintainable code? Terrible. \nDocumenting s\
      aid terrible code? Ironically, also terrible.\n\nYour job, should you choose to accept the awes\
      omeness of it, would be to throw \nout all of my terrible code (with glee) and create a well-do\
      cumented, \nmaintainable, secure, and most of all, blazing fast infrastructure. Don't \nforget \
      the glee -- you're also required to make fun of my code at every \nopportunity.\n\nI know, it s\
      ounds like loads of fun and you've probably already applied, but \nkeep in mind that we're runn\
      ing a very high-traffic production WordPress-based \nsite -- during peak times we're seeing 30-\
      50 page views per second, and even in \nthe middle of the night, we're talking about hundreds t\
      o thousands of hits \nevery single second of every day.\n\nTo handle the huge load of daily vis\
      itors, we're using Fastly's amazing \nvarnish-based caching servers. That's right, Fastly is so\
      \ good they can even \novercome my terrible coding. Unless I decide to wipe the Fastly cache in\
      \ the \nmiddle of the day and the source server can\u2019t handle the load to rebuild the \ncac\
      he. That\u2019s when things get interesting. Yes, this happened last Thursday and \nnow Googleb\
      ot is mad at us.\n\nEven a small programming error can take down a server when your buggy code \
      is \nrunning 500 times per second, and since we don\u2019t even have a QA environment I\u2019m \n\
      deploying code from my laptop straight to production. Did I mention that you \nneed to help us \
      create proper dev/QA environments, build scripts, and use \nsource control properly? Also, docu\
      mentation.\n\nHere are just a few of the interesting and challenging projects you'll work on:\n\n\
      \ * Completely redoing the site with a clean, fast, trimmed-down, modern, \nresponsive design. \
      And maybe this time it\u2019ll like, validate or something, \nunlike our current one that\u2019\
      s still using YUI grids CSS from the mid-2000s. \n * Rebuilding our internal article editing an\
      d scheduling system - we've \ncustomized WordPress a lot, and racked up a lot of technical debt\
      . \n * Building an in-house ad system from the ground up. We\u2019re trying to build \nfriendly\
      , high-quality ads embedded directly in the page without any \nJavaScript.\_(This doesn't neces\
      sarily have to be built completely with PHP and \nWordPress) \n * Building a new internal stats\
      \ and reporting system tied to pageviews and \nour internal ad system. With hundreds of million\
      s of ad impressions each month, \nit ends up being a lot of data, making decent reports a very \
      difficult task. \n(This doesn't necessarily have to be built with PHP and WordPress) \n * Integ\
      rating the internal stats and reporting with affiliate vendor \nreporting so we can more easily\
      \ count the pennies when people click stuff. \n * Building a better, well-documented infrastruc\
      ture that could be rebuilt \nquickly in case of total server failure. \n * Rebuilding our email\
      \ newsletter template, which sends to 100k+ people every \nweekday with a 60% open rate. It doe\
      sn't look great on all devices right now. \nThere are a lot more important things that we'll ne\
      ed you to work on, but I'm \npretty sure you've got the idea.\_\n\nYou'll get benefits:\n\n401k\
      \ matching at 4%\n\nfree short-term disability insurance\n\nhealth insurance where we cover 100\
      % of the premium\n\n160 hours of paid vacation a year\_\n\n Skills & Requirements \n\nWe\u2019r\
      e looking for a motivated, self-starting, experienced programmer that also \nhas experience man\
      aging Linux web servers in a high-traffic environment.\n\nWhat that means in non-buzzword lingo\
      \ is that we\u2019ve got a lot of traffic and I \ndon\u2019t have the time or desire to micro-m\
      anage you, so you\u2019ll need to get things \ndone without me having to bug you all the time \u2014\
      \ and the servers need to always \nstay running and secure, so this shouldn't be your first rod\
      eo.\_\n\nResponsibilities\n\n * Making sure Lowell doesn't write code. Which means, you will be\
      \ in charge \nof writing all the great, maintainable, well-documented code. \n * Documenting ev\
      erything. Writing and communication skills are very important.\n * Managing all of our Linux se\
      rvers, updates, patches, and the rest. \n * Creating a build and QA environment with proper sou\
      rce control and build \nscripts. \n * Making sure that our infrastructure is secure from top to\
      \ bottom.\_ \n * Working with Lowell and the editorial staff on requirements for all of the \np\
      rojects. \n * Actually using your vacation time so you don't burn yourself out. \nWhat we are u\
      sing (So these are the skills you'll preferably have)\n\n * WordPress (and thus, PHP) is non-op\
      tional, we have 15,000 articles already \npublished and too much invested in the ecosystem. Any\
      thing relating to editing \nor scheduling articles and supporting our dozen+ writers must be do\
      ne in \nWordPress. \n * Must be great with JavaScript and jQuery for all of our internal \nadmi\
      nistration screens. Although these days, are you even a programmer if you \ndon't know JavaScri\
      pt? \n * Fastly Varnish VCL for our front-end caching servers. They have an amazing \nsystem an\
      d we've spent a lot of time making our system work with theirs. \n * Nginx web server running o\
      n Linux with php-fpm and the ngx_pagespeed module.\nWe'd prefer candidates with a college degre\
      e. US-based candidates only.\n\n About How-To Geek \n\nHow-To Geek is the largest tech how-to s\

      we need to build.\n\nAgile practices are our norm, whilst we organise ourselves on Jira, Atlass\
      ian \nand GitHub, keeping in constant daily contact with one-another on Skype.\n\nWe love deliv\
      ering, innovating & collaborating and support each other in our \nindividual learnings and grou\
      p challenges.\n\nYou will work remotely for us, probably from your home in Eastern Europe or \n\
      the APAC region, and we will do everything possible to make you feel part of \nthe team... incl\
      uding a trip to London once or twice a year.\_\n\nYou will be expected to work 8 hours per week\
      day. To ensure effective \ncommunication with the rest of the team, and also to take part in re\
      quired \nagile ceremonies and meetings, your working day must include the hours 10:00 to \n14:0\
      0 GMT, including during British Summer Time.\n\nAbout the job\n\nYou\u2019ll be joining our fro\
      nt-end team, working primarily with Angular.js on our \nweb portal application. Strong experien\
      ce is required in this area along with \nits underpinnings: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\n\nThe w\
      eb portal enables users to access and search records, listen to \nrecordings, perform administr\
      ation tasks, configure and view reports, view \ndashboard metrics, and see the results of our s\
      peech, semantic analysis and \nother machine learning system outputs. Some of the features you\u2019\
      ll be building \nwill be straightforward CRUD, while others will involve rich and highly bespok\
      e \nfunctionality.\n\nWe also have a server side component written in Node.js for performing \n\
      administrative functions relating to organisations, users, authentication, etc. \nYou must have\
      \ at least an intermediate level of Node.js experience. We\u2019ll \nprovide you with the suppo\
      rt necessary to build your experience to an advanced \nlevel if necessary.\n\nAbout you \n\nYou\
      \ care about quality: not just in the end product, but also in delivering \ncode that other dev\
      elopers can maintain.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t dream of working outside of a continuous integration\
      \ environment \nand whilst you\u2019re self-sufficient in the areas you know, you also aren\u2019\
      t afraid \nto ask for help when you need it.\n\nYour skills \n\n * Angular.js: strong experienc\
      e with Angular 1.x. \n * Node.js: intermediate level or better. \n * MongoDB. \n * Frontend tes\
      ting: Mocha / Jasmine / Karma or similar. \n * Asynchronous coding techniques: callbacks / Prom\
      ises / the async library. \n * Using JavaScript build tools: grunt / gulp / webpack. \n * Using\
      \ JavaScript package managers: npm / bower / yarn. \n * Javascript: you\u2019re an expert, but \
      also know when to rely on CSS to save a \nCPU cycle or two. \n * HTML5 and CSS3. \n * RESTful J\
      SON APIs. \n * Refactoring skills: you know how to improve code that is out-of-date and \nnot w\
      ell maintained when necessary. \n * Clean coding and documentation: you write code that is easy\
      \ for others to \nunderstand first and foremost, only adding comments and documentation when \n\
      truly necessary. You avoid writing clever or elegant code at the expense of \nreadability. \n *\
      \ Excellent browser debugging and troubleshooting skills - primarily on \ndesktop browsers, but\
      \ this may expand to mobile devices should our business \nrequirements change. \n * Security in\
      grained: You know your CAPTCHAs from your SQL injection from \nyour brute force attacks, and ho\
      w to specify and develop to mitigate them. \n * English: not only did you understand this adver\
      t, but you could write it \ntoo - and more importantly, you can debate your technical solutions\
      \ with \ndevelopers and business people around the world. \nDesirable skills \n\n * Experience \
      with the LESS CSS preprocessor (or Sass). \n * Express and Connect middleware. \n * Graphic / d\
      esign / UX skills. \n * Experience using Docker and Vagrant. \n * OAuth 2.0 APIs and passport.j\
      s. \nWho are Recordsure \n\nGenuinely the leader in providing face-to-face recording solutions \
      in \nFinancial Services, we have also now started providing solutions to government.\n\nOur new\
      \ approach to evaluating sales conversations and interviews using \nArtificial Intelligence is \
      gathering steam - and has enough wow factor to start \ntaking on the $billion companies that pr\
      ovide 'customer contact analytics' - as \nwe have a world class speech, language and data scien\
      ce team and some amazing \ndevelopers, testers and technical operations experts to wrap it all \

   content: "Full-time\n\n(Anywhere) \n\nCompany Overview\n\nLullabot is a prestigious digital agency\
      \ doing bleeding edge Drupal and \nJavaScript development for large entertainment media compani\
      es. We deal in \u2018big \ncontent,\u2019 helping companies like NBC Universal, Turner Broadcas\
      ting, Martha \nStewart Living Omnimedia, and George Lucas Educational Foundation achieve their \n\
      digital marketing dreams.\n\nChances are good that working for Lullabot will be like nothing yo\
      u've ever \ndone before. Lullabot has been a leader in Drupal-focused web development since \no\
      ur founding in 2006. We\u2019re a distributed company without a central office, and \nwe hire t\
      he best talent wherever those people may live. Our team is spread out \nacross the US, Canada, \
      and Europe. Most of us work from home. We are masters of \ncommunication and our tightly-knit t\
      eam works closely despite geographical \nseparation. In fact, most new employees say they feel \
      more connected to their \nco-workers at Lullabot than they ever did at a conventional co-locate\
      d company.\n\nLullabot hires humble individuals who strive for excellence and lifelong \nlearni\
      ng with the ultimate aim of helping others.\n\nJob Summary\n\nWe\u2019re hiring a full-time fro\
      nt-end developer with expertise in CSS, \nJavaScript, and React/Redux application development. \
      This position requires 30 \nhours per week of client billable work usually dedicated to a singl\
      e project, \nand another 10 hours of learning, communicating and making the web a better \nplac\
      e for everyone through open source contribution and knowledge sharing.\n\nResponsibilities and \
      Duties\n\nThe ideal candidate will be willing and eager to:\n\n * Work in service of Lullabot\u2019\
      s clients, team members, and the web-at-large, \nwhile embodying ourcore values <https://www.lu\
      llabot.com/values> in their work.\n * Collaborate openly with designers and back-end developers\
      \ to translate \nvisual designs based on business and functional requirements into well-crafted\
      \ \nfront-end components.\n * Apply front-end design patterns and best practices to ensure site\
      s are \nperformant and cross-browser compatible.\n * Write, write and write some more. Lullabot\
      \ hires individuals who write \nwell, believing that good writers are good thinkers and tend to\
      \ flourish in a \ndistributed company where communication is often asynchronous.\nA typical day\
      \ might begin with a Lullabot team call or some written \ncommunication time, followed by a pro\
      ject scrum, and then finish with \nfour-to-six hours of writing, testing, and documenting code,\
      \ usually for a \nsingle project.\nThe chosen candidate will report to the front-end developmen\
      t manager, Sean \nLange <https://www.lullabot.com/about/sean-lange>, and also be accountable to\
      \ \nthe project manager on their specific project. But fear not, these \nrelationships are not \
      meant to be hierarchical or controlling, but rather \nmutually beneficial, supporting your deve\
      lopment and growth. Also, you won\u2019t \nfind better colleagues to learn from or a more recep\
      tive audience to teach.\n\nThe chosen candidate must be willing and able to travel, up to one w\
      eek per \nmonth. Also, the candidate must actively participate in communicating with \nother Lu\
      llabots in tickets, Yammer, Slack, through articles, and on calls.\nWe have flexible hours, but\
      \ we tend to schedule meetings during the North \nAmerican workday and expect employees to be o\
      nline and available during most of \nthis time.\n\nAreas of focus for this position will includ\
      e:\n\n * Front-end Architecture: Helps make the decisions that lead to a \nsustainable, compone\
      nt-based architecture that minimizes technical debt and \nallows others to navigate the codebas\
      e.\n * Responsive Design: Make sure our mobile first designs look good on every \nconceivable v\
      iewport. We think of breakpoints not so much in terms of mobile, \ntablet, desktop, but rather \
      as the point where a design starts to break as the \nviewport expands.\n * Accessibility: Which\
      \ involves ensuring that a website appears correctly on \nall devices and browsers, including f\
      or those with limitations. For more on \nLullabot\u2019s work around accessibility, visit ourac\
      cessibots website \n<http://www.accessibots.com/>.\n * Usability: Strive for simplicity. Make i\
      nviting websites that work for \nordinary users rather than websites that overwhelm.\n * Perfor\
      mance: We work on high-profile, high-traffic websites and a deep \nunderstanding of front-end p\
      erformance is essential.\nTechnical Qualifications\n\nWhile some of these qualifications may be\
      \ aspirational, this list reflects the \ngeneral skill-level we expect:\n\n * B.S. Degree (or e\
      quivalent) in Computer Science or related field, or 2+ \nyears working experience as a front-en\
      d developer or related field.\n * Knowledge of current front-end design patterns and best pract\
      ices.\n * Experience with responsive design.\n * Expertise in cross-browser compatibility and p\
      rogressive enhancement.\n * Experience with version control systems.\n * Familiarity with CSS/J\
      avaScript code-quality tools.\n * Experience with preprocessors: Sass.\n * Knowledge of front-e\
      nd performance techniques.\n * Familiarity with Drupal development and coding standards.\n * Ex\
      perience with enterprise-level deployment and build processes.\n\nJavaScript Knowledge\n\n * Ac\
      tive knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem over the last 18 months.\n * Use of ReactJS (ideally\
      \ having launched large-scale applications).\n * Flux or similar data-flow architectures (We us\
      e Redux).\n * Gulp, npm, Webpack, Babel, Eslint, Mocha, PostCSS are all JS tools that we \nuse \
      on a daily basis.\n * Knowledge of video streaming techniques. Many apps that Lullabot works on\
      \ \nare made purely to stream video. Although we often don't write the video \nprocessing logic\
      \ ourselves, it does help to have a general understanding.\n * Experience with BrightScript and\
      \ Roku app development a plus.\nAttributes\n\n * Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.\n\
      \ * Thorough attention to detail, quality, and precision.\n * Ability to keep your cool, or, pu\
      t another way, the ability to manage \nmultiple, time-sensitive tasks, while attending to the n\
      ext right thing.\n * Experience working with large, distributed software teams is a plus.\nBene\
      fits and Perks\n\nLullabot is distributed, but not a \"virtual\" company. The majority of our \n\
      workers are full-time employees, and we provide a great benefits package \nincluding health, vi\
      sion, dental, and life insurance; a retirement plan; a \ngenerous tech stipend for employees to\
      \ purchase computers, cell phones, etc.; \nand a stock options package once you reach your two-\
      year anniversary. We offer \nnew employees 15 paid-days-off per year plus holidays, which goes \
      up to 20 days \non your two-year anniversary. And did we mention there's no commute? Your time \n\
      is flexible as well, so if you're a night-owl and do your best work after dark, \nor you need t\

      is is your first chance to try it out with us! Create a brief (2 \nmin or less) video introduci\

      and \nJavaScript development for large entertainment media companies. We deal in \u2018big \nco\
      ntent,\u2019 helping companies like NBC Universal, Turner Broadcasting, Martha \nStewart Living\
      \ Omnimedia, and George Lucas Educational Foundation achieve their \ndigital marketing dreams.\n\n\
      Chances are good that working for Lullabot will be like nothing you've ever \ndone before. Lull\
      abot has been a leader in Drupal-focused web development since \nour founding in 2006. We\u2019\
      re a distributed company without a central office, and \nwe hire the best talent wherever those\
      \ people may live. Our team is spread out \nacross the US, Canada, and Europe. Most of us work \
      from home. We are masters of \ncommunication and our tightly-knit team works closely despite ge\
      ographical \nseparation. In fact, most new employees say they feel more connected to their \nco\
      -workers at Lullabot than they ever did at a conventional co-located company.\n\nLullabot hires\
      \ humble individuals who strive for excellence and lifelong \nlearning with the ultimate aim of\
      \ helping others.\n\nJob Summary\n\nWe\u2019re hiring a full-time front-end developer with expe\
      rtise in CSS, \nJavaScript, and React/Redux application development. This position requires 30 \n\
      hours per week of client billable work usually dedicated to a single project, \nand another 10 \
      hours of learning, communicating and making the web a better \nplace for everyone through open \
      source contribution and knowledge sharing.\n\nResponsibilities and Duties\n\nThe ideal candidat\
      e will be willing and eager to:\n\n * Work in service of Lullabot\u2019s clients, team members,\
      \ and the web-at-large, \nwhile embodying ourcore values <https://www.lullabot.com/values> in t\
      heir work. \n * Collaborate openly with designers and back-end developers to translate \nvisual\
      \ designs based on business and functional requirements into well-crafted \nfront-end component\
      s. \n * Apply front-end design patterns and best practices to ensure sites are \nperformant and\
      \ cross-browser compatible. \n * Write, write and write some more. Lullabot hires individuals w\
      ho write \nwell, believing that good writers are good thinkers and tend to flourish in a \ndist\
      ributed company where communication is often asynchronous. \nA typical day might begin with a L\
      ullabot team call or some written \ncommunication time, followed by a project scrum, and then f\
      inish with \nfour-to-six hours of writing, testing, and documenting code, usually for a \nsingl\
      e project. The chosen candidate will report to the front-end development \nmanager,Sean Lange <\
      https://www.lullabot.com/about/sean-lange>, and also be \naccountable to the project manager on\
      \ their specific project. But fear not, \nthese relationships are not meant to be hierarchical \
      or controlling, but rather \nmutually beneficial, supporting your development and growth. Also,\
      \ you won\u2019t \nfind better colleagues to learn from or a more receptive audience to teach.\n\n\
      The chosen candidate must be willing and able to travel, up to one week per \nmonth. Also, the \
      candidate must actively participate in communicating with \nother Lullabots in tickets, Yammer,\
      \ Slack, through articles, and on calls. We \nhave flexible hours, but we tend to schedule meet\
      ings during the North American \nworkday and expect employees to be online and available during\
      \ most of this \ntime.\n\nAreas of focus for this position will include:\n\n * Front-end Archit\
      ecture: Helps make the decisions that lead to a \nsustainable, component-based architecture tha\
      t minimizes technical debt and \nallows others to navigate the codebase. \n * Responsive Design\
      : Make sure our mobile first designs look good on every \nconceivable viewport. We think of bre\
      akpoints not so much in terms of mobile, \ntablet, desktop, but rather as the point where a des\
      ign starts to break as the \nviewport expands. \n * Accessibility: Which involves ensuring that\
      \ a website appears correctly on \nall devices and browsers, including for those with limitatio\
      ns. For more on \nLullabot\u2019s work around accessibility, visit ouraccessibots website \n<ht\
      tp://www.accessibots.com/>. \n * Usability: Strive for simplicity. Make inviting websites that \
      work for \nordinary users rather than websites that overwhelm. \n * Performance: We work on hig\
      h-profile, high-traffic websites and a deep \nunderstanding of front-end performance is essenti\
      al. \nTechnical Qualifications\n\nWhile some of these qualifications may be aspirational, this \
      list reflects the \ngeneral skill-level we expect:\n\n * B.S. Degree (or equivalent) in Compute\
      r Science or related field, or 2+ \nyears working experience as a front-end developer or relate\
      d field. \n * Knowledge of current front-end design patterns and best practices. \n * Experienc\

      t show as the current page and highlight it or the parent page in \nthe menu. To solve this, yo\
      u would find another example in our internal \nknowledge base or research it or write it and up\

      re \ncurrently lacking power in the backend/API \"department\".\nWhat am I going to do?\nThe th\
      ings you do the best. We believe that we can get the best out of our \npeople if we focus on th\
      e things they do best. If chosen, you will have a \nmonth-long (or two month) testing period wh\
      ere we see how you fit in the team \nand how you perform at your work.\n\nProactive approach is\
      \ most wanted since we're not a big company and we don't \nhave a development/programming depar\
      tment. Meaning if you see something that \nshould be fixed or made better and you can do it, th\
      en do it.\n\nIf you know you can improve something, just do it.\nNow to the real business...\nO\
      ur backend code needs a bit of a \"face-lift\" and some optimization and \nrefactoring. At the \
      same time, we would like to change a bit how we are \nbuilding our application.\n\nWe are very \
      keen on approaches that would allow us to extract some of the code \nfrom Rails so we could man\
      age it better and at the same time speed up our most \nvaluable tests.\n\nWe're not aiming for \
      the \"big rewrite\". What we have in mind is a gradual \napproach to improving our code. An evo\
      lution of some kind.\nWhat do I need?\n\n * Experience of growing and sustaining software over \
      several years\n * Solid knowledge of Ruby\n * Solid knowledge of Rails\n * Productive with CI a\
      nd continuous deployment\n * Understanding of REST\n * Experience in designing and implementing\
      \ APIs\n * Great relationship with Git (we use feature branches approach)\n * Previous experien\
      ce with refactoring code (preferably not just your own)\n * Curious gene (you have to love test\
      ing new stuff and doubting and improving \nold)\n * Openness to other platforms and approaches/\
      methodologies\nWhat will make me cut the hiring line? (Any of the skills below so we can \nbeco\
      me more cross-functional)\n * Extraordinary refactoring skills\n * Extraordinary speed optimiza\
      tion skills (Rails, PostgreSQL)\n * Some front end development experience (AngularJS, React)\n \
      * Google Cloud (Kubernetes + Docker) knowledge (AWS won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hu\

      ces in good OO manner\n * Collaborating with frontend developers to find the best solution for \n\

      e their digital marketing dreams.\nChances are good that working for Lullabot will be like noth\
      ing you've ever \ndone before. Lullabot has been a leader in Drupal-focused web development sin\
      ce \nour founding in 2006. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re a distributed company witho\
      ut a central \noffice, and we hire the best talent wherever those people may live. Our team is \n\
      spread out across the US, Canada, and Europe. Most of us work from home. We are \nmasters of co\
      mmunication and our tightly-knit team works closely despite \ngeographical separation. In fact,\
      \ most new employees say they feel more \nconnected to their co-workers at Lullabot than they e\
      ver did at a conventional \nco-located company.\nLullabot hires humble individuals who strive f\
      or excellence and lifelong \nlearning with the ultimate aim of helping others. \_\nJob Summary\n\
      We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re hiring a full-time front-end developer with expertise \
      in CSS, \nJavaScript, and React/Redux application development. This position requires 30 \nhour\
      s per week of client billable work usually dedicated to a single project, \nand another 10 hour\
      s of learning, communicating\_and making the web a better \nplace for everyone through open sou\
      rce contribution and knowledge sharing.\nResponsibilities and Duties\nThe ideal candidate will \
      be willing and eager to:\n\n * Work in service of Lullabot\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\
      \ clients, team members, and the \nweb-at-large, while embodying our\_core values <https://www.\
      lullabot.com/values>\n\_in their work.\n * Collaborate openly with designers and back-end devel\
      opers to translate \nvisual designs based on business and functional requirements into well-cra\
      fted \nfront-end components.\n * Apply front-end design patterns and best practices to ensure s\
      ites are \nperformant and cross-browser compatible.\n * Write, write and write some more. Lulla\
      bot hires individuals who write \nwell, believing that good writers are good thinkers and tend \
      to flourish in a \ndistributed company where communication is often asynchronous.\nA typical da\
      y might begin with a Lullabot team call or some written \ncommunication time, followed by a pro\
      ject scrum, and then finish with \nfour-to-six hours of writing, testing, and documenting code,\
      \ usually for a \nsingle project.\nThe chosen candidate will report to the front-end developmen\
      t manager,\_Sean \nLange <https://www.lullabot.com/about/sean-lange>, and also be accountable t\
      o \nthe project manager on their specific project. But fear not, these \nrelationships are not \
      meant to be hierarchical or controlling, but rather \nmutually beneficial, supporting your deve\
      lopment and growth. Also, you \nwon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t find better colleagues\
      \ to learn from or a more receptive audience to \nteach.\nThe chosen candidate must be willing \
      and able to travel, up to one week per \nmonth. Also, the candidate must actively participate i\
      n communicating with \nother Lullabots in tickets, Yammer, Slack, through articles, and on call\
      s.\_\nWe have flexible hours, but we tend to schedule meetings during the North \nAmerican work\
      day and expect employees to be online and available during most of \nthis time.\nAreas of focus\
      \ for this position will include:\n\n * Front-end Architecture:\_Helps make the decisions that \
      lead to a \nsustainable, component-based architecture that minimizes technical debt and \nallow\
      s others to navigate the codebase.\n * Responsive Design:\_Make sure our mobile first designs l\
      ook good on every \nconceivable viewport. We think of breakpoints not so much in terms of mobil\
      e, \ntablet, desktop, but rather as the point where a design starts to break as the \nviewport \
      expands.\n * Accessibility:\_Which involves ensuring that a website appears correctly on \nall \
      devices and browsers, including for those with limitations. For more on \nLullabot\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099\
      s work around accessibility, visit our\_accessibots website \n<http://www.accessibots.com/>.\n \
      * Usability: Strive for simplicity. Make inviting websites that work for \nordinary users rathe\
      r than websites that overwhelm.\n * Performance:\_We work on high-profile, high-traffic website\
      s and a deep \nunderstanding of front-end performance is essential.\nTechnical Qualifications\n\
      While some of these qualifications may be aspirational, this list reflects the \ngeneral skill-\
      level we expect:\_\n\n * B.S. Degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science or related field, or 2\
      + \nyears working experience as a front-end developer or related field.\n * Knowledge of curren\
      t front-end design patterns and best practices.\n * Experience with responsive design.\n * Expe\

      ts package \nincluding health, vision, dental, and life insurance; a\_retirement plan; a \ngene\
      rous tech stipend for employees to purchase computers, cell phones, etc.; \nand a stock options\
      \ package once you reach your two-year anniversary. We offer \nnew employees 15 paid-days-off p\
      er year plus holidays, which goes up to 20 days \non your two-year anniversary. And did we ment\

      est work after dark, \nor you need to take a break to pick the kids up from school, it's usuall\
      y not a \nproblem.\nOptional Video\_\nAs a distributed team, we frequently use video calls and \
      the like to stay \nconnected. This is your first chance to try it out with us! Create a brief (\
      2 \nmin or less) video introducing yourself and talking about your interest and \nexperience fo\

   content: "Website: www.artbrowserapp.com\r\n\r\nArtBrowser is a global marketplace for art lovers \
      to discover artworks by a selection of independent artists and galleries. Art lovers can browse\
      \ artworks using our unique Tinder style like/dislike button; view the most trending artworks; \
      follow their favourite artists or galleries and receive personalised invites to events and exhi\
      bitions.\r\n\r\nArtBrowser solves a number of problems for art lovers, artists and galleries. I\
      t provides a unique browsing experience for art lovers looking to browse artworks by hundreds o\
      f artists and galleries in one place. They can connect with their favourite artists and galleri\
      es and save on commission (50%) by buying directly from the artists.\r\n\r\nFor artists and gal\
      leries ArtBrowser provides a great platform to cater to the rapidly growing online art industry\
      \ which is already valued at over $2.64 billion and expected to triple in the next 5 years. For\
      \ small and emerging artists ArtBrowser will also help democratise the world of selling art whi\
      ch is controlled by art galleries and it is often very difficult for them to enter.\r\n\r\nThe \
      most innovative feature of ArtBrowser is the unique Tinder style swipe like/dislike browsing ex\
      perience. Art lovers can also view the most trending artworks across different categories (Port\
      raits, Photographs, etc.) They can follow their favourite artists and galleries and receive ann\
      ouncements (via their personal feed) inviting them to events and exhibitions.\r\n\r\nAnother as\
      pect which distinguishes ArtBrowser from other online galleries (Artfinder, etc.) is the fact t\
      hat it is a genuine marketplace playing host to a huge number and wide variety of artists and g\
      alleries. There are other marketplaces which sell art (for example Etsy) however they do not sp\
      ecialise in selling art and thus unlikely to attract serious art lovers. Also ArtBrowser is per\
      haps the first mobile platform for promoting artworks and events in the visual arts industry. T\
      he mobile app industry is growing rapidly and by being a mobile platform ArtBrowser can disting\
      uish itself from competition.\r\n\r\nSkills & Requirements: \r\nProblem solver & able to think \
      on your feet. \r\nIncredible passion for web/app development\r\nExperience with User Analytics \r\n\

      T web application. You\u2019ll get to work across the full development lifecycle in a truly agi\
      le environment.\r\n\r\nAll development is done in-house from scratch, so you will face technica\
      lly complex problems and devise elegant solutions. This is an excellent opportunity for an ambi\
      tious junior to mid-level C# developer to join a small, talented team based in central London (\
      Southwark).\r\n\r\nAttitude matter more than experience for this role. We don't need you to hav\

      You:\r\n\r\nIf you love coding we\u2019d love to hear from you. You don't need to know everythi\
      ng, but you should be self-driven and hungry to learn. If you're the kind of person who spots s\
      omething that can be done better and gets on with it, you're probably the kind of person we're \
      looking for.\r\n\r\nWhat you'll be working on:\r\n\r\n    C#, ASP.NET MVC 5, WCF, SQL Server, I\
      oC\r\n    Support (and learn from) our senior developer;\r\n    Understanding functional requir\

      hooting and optimising the existing application\r\n\r\nWhat we need from you:\r\n\r\n    Strong\
      \ C# skills and knowledge of .Net design patterns;\r\n    Some experience with SQL Server;\r\n \

      orm community and continue to create new products and experiences. This is more than just a cod\
      ing role. We expect you to join us in working out what we build and how we do it, to join us br\
      ainstorm, research, prototype and test. We need to solve some very hard problems, together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\

      \ other hardware, using languages based on C++\r\n* Our e-commerce site is built on Wordpress, \
      with WooCommerce (managed by a freelance developer)\r\n\r\nWork that may be coming our way this\
      \ year: growing community features on our learning platform, creating a mobile/tablet app for o\

      e weekly. We use pull requests to review code, maintain quality and learn from each other. We u\
      se TDD and pair programming when it makes sense. We use continuous integration tools to automat\

      able.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll manage the relationship with our offshore development team of two dedi\
      cated PHP developers plus QC, front end and iOS resources and we\u2019ll expect you to lead the\
      \ recruitment and development of a small internal engineering team in the near future. In other\

      conversion and retention. You\u2019ll support our customer support team, helping to resolve pro\
      blems for the thousands of parents who rely on our service.\r\n\r\n*About you*\r\nThis role is \
      a leadership position and you\u2019ll work closely with both our CEO and CMO. As well as being \
      a first class technologist you\u2019ll be able to hold your own in discussions about product an\
      d business development. You\u2019ll be a self-starter, a problem solver and have great attentio\
      n to detail.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll definitely have:\r\n\r\n* Deep knowledge (5+ years at a senior \
      level) of PHP/MySQL plus at least one other language (Python, Ruby, C# etc.)\r\n* Knowledge of \

      * Knowledge of front-end frameworks and tools (Bootstrap, Angular, D3 etc)\r\n* Experience in e\
      -commerce, particularly subscription billing\r\n* Experience in a small business or start-up\r\n\
      * Experience of working on product development\r\n* Knowledge of the education sector or of chi\
      ld-centred products\r\n* Experience working with (and probably refactoring/rewriting some of) a\

      \ \r\n\r\n* Problem Solve: We don\u2019t settle for \u2018this is how it has always been done\u2019\
      \ or \u2018no that can\u2019t be done\u2019. We look for solutions.\r\n* Results-focussed: We w\
      ork towards clear actions to get results. \r\n* Helpful and supportive: We\u2019re a small team\
      , so it\u2019s important to help and support one another to make EdPlace the best it can be.\r\n\

      * We care: We take pride in helping parents support their child\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf\
      \ reading this gets you excited, we\u2019d love to hear from you.\r\n"

      d every day.\nYou\u2019ll be working on big, exciting projects like optimizing our queuing \nsy\
      stem, building out React components, adding support for social media \nplatform-specific featur\
      es like native video, and getting our onboarding \njuuuust right so that every user has a mind-\
      blowing experience from their very \nfirst login.\n\nYou\u2019ll be joining a small team of tal\
      ented full-stack developers, and working \nalongside dedicated UX designers, QA and Customer Ex\
      perience pros.\n\nOur stack is Rails 4, Ruby 2.2, Heroku, Postgres, S3, Sidekiq + Redis with \n\
      Webpack, React and Redux on the front-end. It\u2019s great stack to work with \neveryday, and w\
      e take our time to write solid code and proper tests to make \nsure it stays that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\

      \ Dev ProcessWe do a fair amount of pair programming and a \nlot of code reviews, we love solid\
      \ tests and CI, and we deploy several times a \nweek. Basically? We\u2019re constantly improvin\
      g our process so we can create an \nideal developer environment - low overheads, high transpare\
      ncy. Estimates were \ninaccurate and irrelevant, so we dropped \u2018em. Artificial deadlines w\
      eren\u2019t \ndoing it for us, so we switched from scrum to pure kanban and never looked \nback\
      . When something isn\u2019t working, we\u2019re not afraid to throw it out and try \nsomething \
      new - so if you have exciting ideas about the dev process and how to \nmake your own job even b\
      etter, you\u2019ll fit right in. (We\u2019re open-minded like \nthat.)\nYou\u2019ll have final \
      responsibility for features you build, from inception all \nthe way through to deployment, so y\
      our teammates know exactly who to shower \nwith praise when you score a big win.\n\nRequirement\
      s- You have experience creating software products that solve real \nuser challenges\n- You\u2019\
      ve got real professional history with React, and Redux \u2013 Webpack & ES6 \nare big plusses\n\
      - Live anywhere in the USA or Canada (need to be able to provide documentation \nof eligibility\
      \ to work in the USA)\n- You love Rails and React\n- You know how to communicate effectively an\
      d work as part of a team with lots \nof different backgrounds and roles\n- Passionate about imp\
      roving the development process and recognize the value \nof an awesome company culture\n- Not a\
      \ jerkAbout UsWe\u2019re a small team of about 25 people, all working \nremotely across the US \
      & Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping \non Slack, along with virtual team me\
      etings and super-futuristic video calls. We \nalso do a twice-annual meetup week where we work \
      together on cool projects all \nday and generally make fools of ourselves all night. We\u2019re\
      \ proudly bootstrapped \nand profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and kee\
      p doing \nthings the way we like. We\u2019re pretty serious about building and maintaining an \n\
      awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks.\nWe'll probably get along if you\u2019\
      re someone who wants to be creative, have a \npretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsi\
      bility, and work with people \nwho make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people you\
      rself. We like \nthose people.)\n\nWe know we\u2019re ridiculously lucky to have this crack squ\
      ad of ambitious, kind, \nindependent little nerds, and we want to keep that going by bringing i\
      n even \nmore people who love geeking out about what they do and doing work they\u2019ll be \ns\
      uper proud of. (And on that note, we\u2019re an equal-opportunity employer \ngenuinely committe\

   content: "Frontend Engineer - Jobs at Zapier - Zapier  <> \n * Jobs @ Zapier <> \nFrontend Enginee\
      r\n Bryan Helmig / November 5, 2015 \n\n\nThanks for taking a look here, but this role has been\
      \ filled. You can check our\nother openings <https://zapier.com/jobs/> and keep an eye out ther\
      e for future \nopenings too!\n\nHi there!\n\nWe're looking for someone to join the engineering \
      team at Zapier. Interested \nin creating a simple product that allows anyone to do complex, inc\
      redible \nthings with the world's APIs? Then read on\u2026\n\nAbout You\n\nYou love building an\
      d learning new things.\n\nMost of what you'll do day-to-day will involve working with our front\
      end, \ndesign and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it \neffortles\
      s to connect different apps together. We use some pretty cool tech - \nwe're transitioning our \
      Backbone.js frontend to a modern React + Redux \narchitecture and having a lot of fun with it. \
      We love ES6 and are embracing a \nfunctional approach to problem solving.\n\nYou've worked with\
      \ teams before on large single-page apps - the frontend \nframework or language doesn't matter \
      much to us - instead, you understand how \nto manage complexity and balance technical limitatio\
      ns with product \nrequirements. Simple and sustainable code, performance and correctness are al\
      l \ntop of mind for you.\n\nYou love working with customers to help understand their needs and \
      translate a \nproduct spec into functional, production ready code.\n\nYou love doing things eff\
      iciently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a \ndisproportionate impact on the business. We \
      believe in systems and processes \nthat let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.\n\n\
      You love learning. Engineering is an ever-evolving world. You enjoy playing \nwith new tech and\
      \ exploring areas that you might not have experience with yet.\n\nYou love to set your own cour\
      se. We're always there to support you, but we \nonly have one fixed team meeting each week and \
      one-on-one meetings every month \nand then we go make things happen.\n\nThings You Might Do\n\n\
      Zapier is a startup, so you'll likely get experience on many different \nprojects across the or\
      ganization. Here are some things you'll get a taste of:\n\n * Build and maintain new user facin\
      g features or overhaul existing ones. \n * Research, guide and execute broad frontend architect\
      ure changes. \n * Work with complex and varied data structures (APIs be crazy!). \n * Ship to h\
      undreds of thousands of users every day. \n * Work and ship product independently. \n * Share w\
      hat you know and learn either one-on-one or with lightning talks to \nthe group. \n * Give back\
      \ to the community via open source and blog posts. \n * Help customers via support to ensure th\
      ey have the best experience possible.\nAbout Zapier\n\nFor the past four years, Zapier has been\
      \ helping people across the world \nautomate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do t\
      hat by helping \neveryone connect the web applications they already use and love.\n\nWe believe\
      \ that there are jobs a computer is best at doing and that there are \njobs a human is best at \
      doing. We want to empower businesses to create \nprocesses and systems that let computers do wh\
      at they are best at doing and let \nhumans do what they are best at doing.\n\nWe believe that w\
      ith the right tools, you can have big impact with less hassle.\n\nWe believe in small teams. Sm\
      all teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean \nless bureaucracy and less management and more\
      \ getting things done.\n\nWe believe that credentials don't say everything. Our CTO has a finan\
      ce \ndegree. Our CEO has an engineering degree. Our CPO has a mechanical engineering \ndegree. \
      What you love doing is way more important than the credentials you have.\n\nWe believe in a saf\
      e, welcoming and inclusive environment. All teammates at \nZapier agree to acode of conduct \n<\
      https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/>.\n\nThe Whole Package\n\nLocation: Planet Eart\
      h.\n\nIf you want to work remote, that's great. If you want to work near others, \nthat's cool \
      too. Our team is distributed across California, Colorado, Illinois, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Miss\
      ouri, Pennsylvania and the UK because it lets us work \nwith the best people. You don't have to\
      \ be located in the USA either. Some of \nthe team live in the United Kingdom, Thailand, New Ze\
      aland and Australia. You \njust have to be talented!\n\nCompensation:\n\n * Competitive salary \
      (we don't use remote as an excuse to pay less) \n * Great healthcare + dental + vision coverage\
      \ \n * Retirement plan with 4% company match \n * Profit sharing \n * 2-3 annual company retrea\
      ts to awesome places \n * 14 weeks paid leave for new parents \nPick your own equipment. We'll \
      set you up with whatever laptop + monitor combo \nyou want plus any software you need.\n\nUnlim\
      ited vacation policy (plus we insist you take at least 2 weeks off each \nyear - this isn't a v\
      ague policy where unlimited vacation means no vacation). \nWork-life balance is really importan\
      t to everyone at Zapier - we believe it and \npractice it!\n\nWork with awesome companies aroun\
      d the world. We partner with great software \ncompanies all over the world and you'll constantl\
      y get tointeract with people \nfrom these great companies <https://zapier.com/zapbook>.\n\nHow \
      to Apply\n\nApplying is fairly straightforward, but a bit unique. These questions help us \ndig\
      \ right into the good stuff rather than wasting time on informational \nfollowup interviews.\n\n\
      \ * Send an email to frontendjobs@zapier.com. (please no agencies - thanks!) \n * Tell us about\
      \ yourself (include how you heard about Zapier and the \nposition). \n * Tell us about the most\
      \ difficult JS/library/software bug you've squashed \n(we love troubleshooting stories). \n * T\
      ell us about the most technically challenging thing you've ever built. \n * Tell us about the l\
      argest application you've worked on. \n * Include links to your portfolio/Github profile or pro\
      vide us with 500+ LOC \nto help us get a feel for how you write code. (We prefer a shareable li\
      nk, such \nas to Dropbox, over an attachment.) \n * Rank at least five of the following in orde\
      r of what you do best, the first \nbeing the best. (For example, \"e, b, j, k, h\". Please don'\
      t rank on how you \nthink we would prioritize!) \na. Refactor to drastically improve load times\
      \ of a complex single-page app.\nb. Refactor to provide smooth rendering performance of a page \
      with hundreds \n(or thousands) of interactive elements.\nc. Implement a rendering system that w\
      orks across client and server so that we \ncan render blog pages and single-page apps with the \
      same code.\nd. Implement an intelligent caching system that leverages local storage and/or \nIn\
      dexedDB.\ne. Implement smarter data APIs across client and server that minimize \nover-fetching\
      .\nf. Radically improve CSS while balancing the needs of designers and developers.\ng. Implemen\
      t real-time syncing so that multiple browsers/devices keep changes \nin sync.\nh. Implement and\
      \ maintain build tools for JS/CSS/image/fonts/etc.\ni. Implement awesome animations that improv\
      e UX.\nj. Implement cool new product features.\nk. Refactor the codebase to better take advanta\
      ge of functional concepts.\n?. If you think we missed something really important, add your own \
      choice! \n(Just be sure to tell us what the? stands for!)\n\nFinally, wait for us to reply. It \
      can take some time to read through all the \napplications, but we do and we reply to everyone, \
      even if it doesn't seem like \na great fit.\n\nOther Openings\n\nWe're also hiring for the foll\
      owing roles.\n\n * Design Team Manager <> \n * Data Team Manager <> \n * Customer Champion - We\

      \ There is a worldwide development team with different areas of responsibility. \n\n Primarily \
      in Europe we are working on the debugger development. \n\n The actual product uses the Eclipse \
      CDT plugins and GDB (GNU Debugger). \n\n The user interface is developed in Java as you would e\
      xpect from an Eclipse \nIDE.\n\n We have different versions of GDBs for each device. We support\
      \ nearly all \nRenesas devices in the IDE. (RL78, RX, RH850, SH and RZ)\n\n We have developed a\

      ach device to perform the low level debug \ncommands.\n\n The GDB server does not have UI and i\
      s developed in C++. The design is OO. \n\n From this development we are using Visual Studio 201\
      0. \n\n Primarily this role focuses on the GDB server development. What we would \nconsider the\
      \ debugger back-end.\n\n However we interface with low level DLLs to communicate with the emula\
      tors \nand hardware.\n\n The development is multi-threaded and this is important to show experi\
      ence in \nthis area.\n\n Renesas devices and emulators have hardware debugging features which c\
      an be \nconsidered proprietary and are not well supported by GDB.\n\n We have special views wit\

      e mainstay of our work is adding this functionality to the IDE. Items such \nas hardware trace,\

      we don't place a lot of importance on educational \nbackground - as a developer your experience\
      , portfolio, and abilities are key, \nnot your grades :). We do need to see some experience of \
      working in web \ndevelopment and creating or contributing to web applications.\_\n\n * HTML \n \
      * CSS \n * LESS \n * JavaScript \n * CoffeeScript \n * Knockout.js \n * Gulp \n * Git \n * Requ\
      ire.js \n * Bower \n * Go \n * ColdFusion \n * MySQL \n * Redis \n * Vagrant/Docker \nOur entir\
      e team works daily with HTML, CSS/LESS, JavaScript (particularly \nKnockout.js),RESTful APIs, a\
      nd integrations, and so, experience in full stack \nweb development is important. However, if y\
      ou are particularly skilled in \nfront-end developent or you are a highly experienced back-end \
      developer, we'd \nlove to hear from you.\n\nMore Info\n\nTeamwork Projects is our flagship prod\
      uct and is used by many of the world's \nbiggest companies, with over 370,000 installations, tw\
      o million daily users and \nmore than three million unique projects. Despite the vast array of \
      features \navailable in Teamwork Projects, it has been built entirely by a small team of \ntale\
      nted developers. We pride ourselves on giving our users what they need and \nare constantly wor\
      king on new features and improvements for our customers.\n\nBy joining our team, you can be ass\
      ured not only that your work will be seen \nand enjoyed by millions of users worldwide, but tha\
      t you will learn and grow \ncontinuously, in a friendly, open environment.\n\nWe care about all\

      me in our Irish \noffice, if you would like to work remotely, if you would like to relocate or \
      if \nyou're already here and ready to start work at Teamwork HQ in Cork, Ireland.\n\n Skills & \
      Requirements \n\nMust Have:\n\nJavaScript: Much of your work is front-end focused and customer-\
      facing, so \nit's important that you are confident in your abilities and able to contribute \nt\
      o new and existing features. While we work in\_Knockout.js, it isn't pivotal \nthat you are exp\
      erienced in any particular framework, although knowledge of any \npopular\_MV* framework is hug\
      ely beneficial.\n\nCoding best practices:\_We work closely as a team on many features, so writi\
      ng \nclean and extensible code is a must. Your code should be easy to debug, while \nyou code, \
      you consider the impact your work has on other developers, the \nproduct in general, and our te\
      sting department.\n\nRESTful API experience: We currently have an extensive API, which is \ncon\
      stantly evolving and growing. Therefore, experience in designing and/or \nintegrating with APIs\
      \ is extremely important to us. Our application is \ndata-driven, so you should be aware of how\
      \ to work with large collections of \ndata while maintaining a great user experience.\n\nThe ri\
      ght attitude: We want you to take as much pride in your work as we do \nand strive to find the \
      right solutions for our customers. The right applicant \nshould be able to think on his or her \
      feet and adapt to new technologies.\n\nHelp us grow and improve:\_At Teamwork.com, we are alway\
      s open to new ideas \nand, more importantly, open to change. We are aware that new technologies\
      \ and \napproaches will come along that need to be embraced. As a Teamwork.com \nDeveloper, you\
      r voice rings loud and, if you know of ways that we can improve, \nwe want to hear your ideas.\n\n\
      Nice to Have:\n\nCoffeeScript\n\nBuild tools:\_Gulp, Grunt, Lineman.js, etc.\n\nFront-end testi\
      ng\_\n\nGo/ColdFusion:\_Our API is written in Go\_and ColdFusion. As we build new \nfeatures, w\
